        <p> One minute you're walking round school, learning stuff, wishing you were at home and then BAM school's shut and you have to fend for yourself for a few months. How the actual heck are you gonna learn all that content by yourself? Surely you're gonna fail your A Levels, and then you won't be able to get a decent job or go to uni and-</p>

        <p>You are sexy, you are powerful, you got this.</p>
        <p>I can't teach you the content you need to know (trust me I SUCK at teaching) but I can make it a little easier for you to organise yourself and figure out how well you're doing. </p>
        <p> I am therefore proud to launch this website, which doesn't have an official name yet. Although I have always liked the name Ross, so let's name it that.</p>
        <p>There's a quick-start guide on how to use the site at the top but I'm hoping I made everything reasonably self-explanatory. If you have any problems with the site, or you just fancy a good old rant about how I'm such a neek for doing this, feel free to email me at <b>boris.johnson.mp@parliament.uk</b>.</p>
