        <li>PLEASE USE A COMPUTER - viewing this website on a phone looks awful and if you try and use the progress trackers it shouts at you.</li>
        <li>Click the shiny 'Download Template' button below to get started. This will download a file called <b>progress.txt</b>. Make sure you know where on your computer it's downloaded to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you're on Windows or Mac it's most likely in the 'Downloads' folder.</li>
            <li>If you're on Linux it's in your ~/Downloads/ folder.</li>
            <li>If you're ChromeOS, I have no idea because I don't know how those filesystems work (sorry I am a bit useless).</li>
          </ul>
        <li>On the website, navigate to the subject you want (all subjects are found in the 'Subjects' section at the top).</li>
        <li>BEFORE YOU DO ANY CHECKBOX TICKING ensure you click the lovely 'Upload Progress' button and select your <b>progress.txt</b> file (downloaded in step 1). Once you've done this, checkbox tick to your heart's content.</li>
        <li>When you've finished with your checkbox-based shennanigans and you want to leave the site, please click the wonderful 'Save Progress' button. This will download a new file called <b>progress(1).txt</b>. Delete your old <b>progress.txt</b> file and rename the  <b>progress(1).txt</b> file to <b>progress.txt</b> so you don't get confused.</li>
        <li>When you come back to the site to continue checkbox-ticking, click the 'Upload Progress' button like before but select your <b>new</b> progress.txt file (the one you renamed) and your progress should appear on-screen.</li>
      </ol>
